# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can use the following commands:

### `npm start`

Starts the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

- The page will automatically reload when changes are made.
- You will see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
For more details, see the section on [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

- The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.
- Your app is now ready for deployment.

For more information on deploying your app, check the [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

> **Warning:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot go back!

If you're not satisfied with the default build tool or configuration, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project. This gives you full control over them.

- After ejecting, all commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts, which you can now modify.
- Be aware that ejecting means you're on your own. The default curated setup is suitable for most small to medium deployments, and you may not need to eject.

You should only eject if you're comfortable managing all the configurations manually.
